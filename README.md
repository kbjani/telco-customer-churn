# telco-customer-churn

The goal of this project is to work with an imbalanced dataset where the minority class is underrepresented to develop effective classification models. We used the Telco Customer Churn dataset to predict churn rate of customers based on the other features. The main challenge we addressed is the class imbalance in the dataset, where the minority (customers who churn) is significantly smaller than the majority class (customers who stay). Training machine learning models on imbalanced data tends to result in models biased towards the majority class, which results in poor prediction results. Our approach for this project involved comparing multiple techniques to handle the class imbalance. We applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to create a balanced dataset for a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and a Random Forest model. We also used the Random Forest algorithm’s capability to handle imbalance by adjusting class weights, testing both a grid-searched optimal ration and the ‘balanced’ preset.
